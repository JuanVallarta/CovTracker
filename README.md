# CovTracker

This interactive shiny/flexdasboard tool allows you to observe the daily number of Covid-19 tests, cases and deaths, and the corresponding average rates per capita (1000 people), reported by each country on a monthly and quarterly basis. 
The tool reads the data folder of this repository which is copied and updated from https://github.com/finddx/FINDCov19TrackerData on a daily basis via github actions (.github/workflows folder)
